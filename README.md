Simple Book-store project.

I created a list of books with titles, autors, ISBN, prices, and quantities.

Retrieved data using C++ from a file.

The txt file is not yet updated for changes during program execution.

Soon will implement this as well.

The ISBN codes are just unique randomly generated numbers, same goes with prices.
